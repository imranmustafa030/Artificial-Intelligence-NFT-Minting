# AI-NFT Minting

![AI-NFT Minting](https://example.com/your-image.png)

AI-NFT Minting is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create and design non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the help of artificial intelligence using Hugging Face models. The minted NFTs are stored on the Ethereum blockchain using IPFS technology provided by NFT.Storage.

## Features

- AI-Powered NFT Minting: Leverage the power of Hugging Face AI models to generate unique and creative NFT designs.
- Ethereum Blockchain Integration: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts and Ethers.js for seamless NFT minting and transaction handling.
- IPFS Integration: Utilize NFT.Storage technology to store and retrieve NFT metadata securely on IPFS.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with React.js, the frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for minting and managing NFTs.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools and technologies installed:

- Solidity: Writing smart contracts and tests.
- Javascript: React development and testing.
- Hardhat: Development framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
- Ethers.js: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- React.js: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- NFT.Storage: Connection to IPFS for storing NFT metadata.
- Hugging Face: AI models for generating NFT designs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/imranmustafa030/Artificial-Intelligence-NFT-Minting.git
```

2. Install the dependencies for the dApp:

```shell
cd AI-NFT-Minting
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the following configuration variables:

```shell
REACT_APP_ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_URL=<ethereum_provider_url>
REACT_APP_NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY=<nft_storage_api_key>
```

2. Replace `<ethereum_provider_url>` with the URL of your Ethereum provider (e.g., Infura).
3. Replace `<nft_storage_api_key>` with your NFT.Storage API key.

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```shell
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the AI-NFT Minting application.

## Deployment

To deploy the dApp, follow these steps:

1. Configure the deployment settings in the `hardhat.config.js` file.
2. Run the deployment script:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```

Replace `<network_name>` with the target Ethereum network (e.g., "rinkeby" for the Rinkeby test network).
